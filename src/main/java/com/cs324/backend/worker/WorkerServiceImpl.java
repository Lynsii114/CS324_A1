/**
 * Worker Node that holds worker state and runs the distributed leader election
 * protocol.
 *
 * <p>Election algorithm (echo/termination aggregation):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An ELECTION message carries a unique election id and a growing set of
 *       discovered participants. Each worker keeps a thread-safe set of
 *       processed election ids so no message is handled twice and message loops
 *       are cut.</li>
 *   <li>The initiator broadcasts over its neighbour ring. Every reachable,
 *       active worker adds its own {@link CandidateInfo} snapshot and re-sends
 *       the message to its neighbours (except the hop it came from), and echoes
 *       the merged participant set back. When all echoes return, every reachable
 *       worker has been discovered.</li>
 *   <li>The winner is the reachable worker with the lowest JAC; ties are broken
 *       by the highest startup priority id (minted by the Phase-1 timer lottery),
 *       then the highest worker id as a safety net.</li>
 *   <li>Phase 1: on a fresh cluster the six workers run a randomized countdown
 *       (150-300 ms); the first to expire claims priority 6, the next 5, down to
 *       1. All JACs are still 0, so the priority-6 worker declares itself the
 *       Initial Coordinator and alerts the other five.</li>
 *   <li>Phase 2: the coordinator re-splits each incoming task into a variable
 *       number of contiguous segments (never more than one per worker, sized by
 *       the input) and hands them to the lowest-JAC workers; every worker that
 *       processes a segment has its own JAC incremented.</li>
 *   <li>Phase 3: after 5 submitted jobs the coordinator broadcasts a Term_End
 *       message with the verified JAC table, steps down, and a new election picks
 *       the lowest-JAC worker (tie -> highest priority id).</li>
 *   <li>The result is broadcast to all participants as a
 *       {@link WinnerAnnouncement}, so every worker records the same
 *       coordinator.</li>
 *   <li>The Bootstrap Node is never involved beyond looking up the active worker
 *       registry and sequencing lottery claims; it does not participate in the
 *       election.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Concurrency strategy (5-job coordinator terms + multithreaded
 * execution):</b> jobs arrive over RMI and can overlap, so all shared mutable
 * state is guarded by concurrent primitives instead of coarse locks:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #jobAllocationCounter} (JAC) - {@link AtomicInteger}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #jobsThisTerm} (per-term submitted-job counter, isolated from the
 *       JAC) - {@link AtomicInteger}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #currentCoordinatorId} - {@link AtomicInteger}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #processedElectionIds} - a concurrent key set, so an election
 *       message is processed at most once even under concurrent arrivals.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #neighbours} - a concurrent key set; the whole ring is swapped
 *       atomically inside the {@code synchronized} {@link #refreshNeighbours()}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A single {@link ExecutorService} ({@link #jobExecutor}) runs submitted jobs
 * and partial computations concurrently. The pool is sized larger than the
 * coordinator term limit so the coordinator can always borrow another thread for
 * its own local section without deadlocking.
